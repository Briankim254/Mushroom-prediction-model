## Introduction
The Mushroom Prediction Model is a machine learning application designed to classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible based on their physical characteristics. Developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the model leverages various machine learning algorithms to deliver accurate predictions. The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for data input and result visualization.

## Features
Accurate mushroom classification using machine learning techniques
User-friendly web interface for data input and result visualization
Detailed information on the prediction process and model performance
Customizable settings to explore different machine learning algorithms
Local Installation & Setup
To install and set up the Mushroom Prediction Model on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using 
```
git clone https://github.com/Briankim254/mushroom-prediction-model.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory using
